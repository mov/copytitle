copytitle
=========
Just extract the "developer@joshuawinn.com" folder at the profile/extension, firefox will load it.
firefox addon copy Only title based on copy tile addon of joshuawinn
this addon only copy tile function which is origially code by joshuawinn in the "Copy Title and Description" addon.
I move the "copy title" menuitem to the top of the "tab context menu", which I think it should be there intuitively.
