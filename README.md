copytitle
=========
Just extract the "developer@joshuawinn.com" folder at the profile/extension, firefox will load it.
firefox addon copy Only title based on copy tile addon of joshuawinn
this addon only copy tile function which is origially code by joshuawinn in the "Copy Title and Description" addon.
*I move the "copy title" menuitem to the top of the "tab context menu", which I think it should be there intuitively.*
------------------------------
To-do list:
* replace the external icon with the original firefox copy icon. 
* accessory key binding[implemented].
* new base64 png icon 
Bug:
Only copy title of current tab. 

Cannot copy title of a unactivated tab or a Addon Manager tab title. 

needs to be fixed.
